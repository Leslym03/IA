<a name="what_is_this"><b>What is this?</b></a>
-------------

&quot;GUN-TACTYX&quot; is a CROBOTS-like game with QUAKE3-style graphics.
You can read more details about the game in the file
&quot;<a href="GUN-TACTYX-manual.htm">GUN-TACTYX-manual.htm</a>&quot;, at the site <a href="http://apocalyx.sf.net">http://apocalyx.sf.net</a> or
at the official site of the game <a href="http://guntactyx.gameprog.it">http://guntactyx.gameprog.it</a>

This program is intended for the Windows platform (Win98 SE or
higher version). The development machine has:

OPSYS        - Windows 98
CPU          - Athlon 800 MHz
RAM          - 256 Mb
GRAPHIC CARD - GeForce FX 5200 (128 Mb)
SOUND CARD   - SoundBlaster Live! 1024

To run the application you need a PC with Windows 98 SE or higher
and OpenGL drivers installed. Hardware 3D acceleration is required
and the resolution of the graphic card must use at least 16 bits
color mode to execute the application full screen or in a window.


<a name="how_to_play"><b>How to play</b></a>
-----------

Players must develop the AI of their own team of bots. The behavior
of the team is controlled by a script written using the SMALL
scripting language. The code of the scripts is contained in files
with extension &quot;.sma&quot; in the &quot;\bots&quot; sub-folder: They are simple text
files that a player can create and modify with his preferred editor.

Once the source of the script is available, say &quot;myBot.sma&quot;, it must
be compiled with the SMALL compiler, a command line compiler named
&quot;sc.exe&quot;, or even through a command of the console of the game
(invoke it pressing the [F3] key). If you choose the external
program, type at the command line from a DOS window:

  sc myBot.sma

and a &quot;myBot.amx&quot; containing the bytecode of the script will appear.

Finally, the player needs to start &quot;GUN-TACTYX.exe&quot; and the script
will be ready to fight against other scripts.

For more information about the game itself and its purpose, read the
attached manual (<a href="GUN-TACTYX-manual.htm">GUN-TACTYX-manual.htm</a>).

Here follows a description of the most important keys and buttons that
a player can use to interact with the application.

When the application starts, you can choose four different modes
of operation pressing the corresponding digit keys or, if you wait
a few seconds, see the rolling demo run. Then other keys enable
particular context sensitive functions. Here is the complete
hierarchy of the keys, but remember that you can show (or hide)
the list pressing [F1] during the run of the application.

[1] Play a single match in 3D mode. During the fights you can see
    the models of the warriors and all the 3D stuff; available keys:
    [I] Enter/exit interactive mode: In interactive mode a player
        can pilot one on the bots using the mouse and the arrow
        keys. To read a complete list of the keys available and
        their meaning, press [F1] during this mode. The behavior
        of the keys is quite different from the usual FPS games
        and a bit of practice is needed, because the performance
        of the bot and its movements are the same accessible to
        AI-driven bots.
    [V] Show/hide the map of the battlefield
    [D] Show/hide the data of the warriors
    [C] Link the camera to one of the warriors circling in a team
    [X] Change the team whose warriors have the camera linked to 
    [Z] Circle views auto/manual
    [T] Follow the target (useful only in &quot;Soccer&quot; mode to follow
        the movement of the ball)
    [+/-] Increase/decrease the time multiplier; the effective
          speed, relative to real time, is shown below the timer.
          Top speeds depends on the machine where the simulation
          runs on
    [M] Music on/off
    [S] Sound on/off
    [MOUSE] Look around
    [L/R BUTTONS] Move forward/backward
    [UP/DOWN] Mode forward/backward (horizontally)

    [PAUSE] Pause on/off
    [1] Restart match with the same teams
    [2] Replay the current match from the beginning
    [3] Restart match with random teams
    [ENTER] Exit
[2] Play a single match in 2D mode. Only the map (top view)
    is active, while 3D models are disabled
    [+/-] Increase/decrease the time multiplier; the effective
          speed, relative to real time, is shown below the timer.
          Top speeds depends on the machine where the simulation
          runs on
    [M] Music on/off
    [PAUSE] Pause on/off
    [1] Restart match with the same teams
    [2] Replay the current match from the beginning
    [3] Restart match with random teams
    [ENTER] Exit
[3] Play random matches in sequence
    [+/-] Increase/decrease the time multiplier; the effective
          speed, relative to real time, is shown below the timer.
          Top speeds depends on the machine where the simulation
          runs on
    [M] Music on/off
    [PAUSE] Pause on/off
    [1] Restart match with the same teams
    [2] Replay the current match from the beginning
    [3] Restart match with random teams
    [ENTER] Exit
[4] Show the results of the random matches
    [M] Music on/off
    [ DEL ] Delete the results
    [ENTER] Exit
[0] (zero) Show the options
    [E] Choose the automatic script that must be executed before
        a match can start. These kind of scripts are stored in
        &quot;\engine&quot; sub-folder.
    [P] Change the default package. Packages are &quot;.dat&quot; files that
        contain all the resources of the game (images, sounds,
        models and scenery)
    [L] Change the default level. Levels are different scenes
        stored in the same package
    [T] Change the number of teams, circling through 4,3,2
    [A] Choose a script for the A team
    [B] Choose a script for the B team
    [C] Choose a script for the C team
    [D] Choose a script for the D team
    [N] Change the number of the team mates from 64 to 1
    [G] Change the goal of the match. Possible values are:
        Terminate enemy chief, terminate enemy team,
        capture enemy sign
    [K] Change the type of the match. Possible values are:
        Fight, Race, Soccer
    [O] Change the duration (in seconds) after which the match ends
    [R] Change the minimum frame rate required during the matches
    [F] Show or hide visual effects (the lens flare of the sun)

    [X] Save the changes made to the options (exit)
    [Q] Discard the changes made to the options (quit)
[T] Change the number of teams, circling through 4,3,2.
    If your machine has poor performances, use a low number
    of teams. The name of the number of teams is shown on the
    screen around the &quot;vs&quot; string
[N] Change the number of the team mates, circling through
    64,32,16,8,4,2,1,64. If your machine has poor performances,
    use a low number of team mates. The number of mates is
    shown on the screen above the &quot;vs&quot; string
[A] Choose a script for the A team
[B] Choose a script for the B team
[C] Choose a script for the C team
[D] Choose a script for the D team
[M] Music on/off
[S] Sound on/off


<a name="known_bugs"><b>Known bugs</b></a>
----------

The current version of the game is the final release 1.1.5

If you find any odd behavior that you think is a bug, send a report
to me at the email address: <a href="mailto:tetractys@users.sourceforge.net">tetractys@users.sourceforge.net</a>

Remember that apparent bugs related to 3D visualization are usually
caused by OpenGL drivers not updated, while very low frame rates
are normal on slower machines. In the latter case you should
reduce the number of warriors or the number of teams (pressing the
[T] and [N] key when the 'intro' screen is shown).


<a name="donations"><b>Donations</b></a>
---------

The APOCALYX Engine and all the related stuff (sources, demos and
games) are provided for free as an open source project. I hope that
my work benefits you as a possible learning tool of particular
coding techniques or as an effective library to be included in your
own programs.

If you find my code useful and want to support further improvements
of the project, you can fund it with donations. The 5% of the
amount you are going to donate will remain to SourceForge.net
for their great hosting service.

Thank you in advance!

<a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/contests/contest.asp?contest=03">http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/contests/contest.asp?contest=03</a>
The sources of his demo were the starting point for the APOCALYX
renderer and many nice effects.

hosted by PolyCount <a href="http://www.polycount.com">http://www.polycount.com</a>), and Tom Poindexter
for creating CROBOTS in the far 1985: That game was a great
source of inspiration for the development of my on-line <a href="http://jrobots.cfxweb.net">JROBOTS
</a>and the design of GUN-TACTYX.
<br>Thanks also to Alan Lund, Walter Nistico, Samuel Grabski,
Moray Goodwin, Christo Fogelberg and Tim Strazny for all the
